!!!!! I used ChatGPT to help me debug the treasure interaction, add animations, and simplify the shader for mixing a solid‑color sky.

Simple story/game (“wow” element) (1 / 1)– World.js, checkTreasure() proximity test; lines 240–255: onTreasureFound() animation.

Performance (≥10 FPS on 32×32) (0.5 / 0.5)– World.js, FPS counter in tick().

Creativity bonus (“Wow!”) (0.5 / 0.5)– World.js, treasure pop‑spin animation.
