I worked with ChatGPT to implement several of the more complex interactions in my Three.js project: it guided me through creating a dynamic red aim‐line that updates in real time as I drag to aim the cue ball, setting up the “Life Lost!” flash message logic to appear briefly whenever the ball falls into a pocket, writing a helper function to place yellow spheres uniformly along each rail, and integrating a restart‐on‐“R” feature that properly resets score, lives, timer, and scene objects after a win or loss. ChatGPT helped me plan the geometry updates, event handling, and state resets needed to make these interactions both responsive and bug‐free.
