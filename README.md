# Assignment 1: Painting (Easy)

## Author
Yufan Weng

## Description
This project is a WebGL-based paint program created for CMPM 160 at UC Santa Cruz. The application allows users to draw shapes (points, triangles, and circles) using an interactive UI with sliders for color (RGB), size, and segment count. Additionally, a custom triangle-based scene was created as part of the assignment requirements.

## AI Assistance Disclosure

I used **ChatGPT**  to assist me in the following ways:

- **Debugging WebGL setup issues** (e.g., correcting uniform variable mismatches like `u_Size` vs `u_PointSize`)
- **Refining the layering and sizing** of my `drawMyTriangleArt()` function so that the layout fits the canvas visually
- **Generating and explaining alpha blending setup** using `gl.blendFunc` and slider-controlled transparency
- **Designing a template of 20 triangles** to match the geometric "sunset over mountains" drawing requirement (Step 12)
- **Suggesting creative ideas for "awesomeness" (Step 13)** including brush modes, transparency, and animation

All final code was reviewed, customized, and implemented by me. ChatGPT served as a tutor and assistant, not a full code generator.
